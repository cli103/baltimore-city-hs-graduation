# Baltimore City High School Graduation Rates Relating to Socioeconomic and Racial Factors

## Background
I used Microsoft Excel to conduct data analysis on the innovation rates of US Colleges. I used open data from Opportunity Insights on College Data to generate a cluster analysis model to determine how different colleges are grouped based on metrics related to student innovation. 

## Business Question
How are different colleges grouped based on metrics related to university size, patent grants and citations obtained by students?

## Baltimore City Open Data:
[High School Completion Rate](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/bniajfi::high-school-completion-rate?geometry=-76.840%2C39.192%2C-76.401%2C39.378&selectedAttribute=compl14)
[Median Household Income] (https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/bniajfi::median-household-income)
[Percent of Students that are African American (non-Hispanic)](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/bniajfi::percent-of-students-that-are-african-american-non-hispanic?geometry=-77.051%2C39.192%2C-76.190%2C39.378&layer=0)
